    for me, it was from my django version (that was 2.1) install higher version (I used 2.1.5 for some reasons) ** delete db.sqlite3, and everything in migration folder except init.py run command:
        pip install django==2.1.5 --upgrade
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        python manage.py runserver
